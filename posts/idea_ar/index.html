This AR app would give real-time about the objets and monuments surrounding the users, such as information about a historic building, a famous sculpture, etc. This AR application would function like a real-time information lens, allowing users to point their devices at an object or landmark to receive instant details and context. For example, pointing the app at a historic building could reveal information about its construction, architectural style, historical significance, and even notable events that took place there. Similarly, when used in a museum, users could point their devices at artifacts or artworks to access more detailed information than traditional inscriptions could provide.">

<p>To avoid an information overload that would be uncomfortable for the user, the information displayed at first is minimal. By pointing at one of the statues, the user could have complete informations about it.</p>

<p>The user is able to view their notifications at all time through small tabs on the side of their vision. By pointing at one notification, they can open it.</p>

</h3>
<p>The prototype was made by using plastic sheets and post-its. Each post-it represent a tab of an appliction with its notifcations.
To have an idea of what the application would feel like in AR, the user has to hold the plastic sheets at the sides of their visions and walk around like that to be used to having notifations hanging around.

<p>The way the tabs capt the attention make it dangerous as people could b to focused on it and not watch where they are walking. In an age where social media already capture too much our attention, this could make it worse. This idea might raise some concerns about its ethical and human well-being implications if it were implemented</p>
